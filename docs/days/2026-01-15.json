          "details": "There was no new homework added today. We spent the day having fun and using this time to wish Jey and Jiwoo good luck. Tomorrow, students will only need to complete the homework that was given on previous days. I will also be expecting more regular logins and activity on ReadWorks and Khan Academy. As a reminder, tomorrow is golf in athletics, so if you have golf gloves, please bring them to school.\n\nIMPORTANT CHOOSE SEMESTER 2 CLUBS (BEFORE TOMORROW)\n\nPlease use the link below to choose your clubs.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/MyczdXU2gT4Q891w6\n\nFirst, make sure you select the correct class.\n\nPlease write your full name clearly so we know who you are.\n\nYou must choose your top 3 clubs in order of preference.\n\nYou can try your clubs for the first 2 weeks only.
