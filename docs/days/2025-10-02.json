          "details": "It’s Chuseok! 🌕✨\n\nThis is a special time for families, so I’ve kept homework to a minimum. I hope you can enjoy relaxing with your loved ones, making happy memories, and coming back to school refreshed and ready to learn.\n\nThe homework list below is mostly a reminder of what should already have been finished before the holiday. The only new assignment is the Chuseok journal, where you can write about your holiday experiences.\n\nIf you’d like some extra practice, you can always use Khan Academy or ReadWorks.\n\nHave a wonderful Chuseok with your family! 🌸\n\nChuseok Language Arts Homework\n\nFor this holiday, your homework is to write at least one Chuseok journal entry before you come back to school. You can write more than one if you want!\nRemember:\nUse the past tense because Chuseok already happened.\n\nTry to compare it with this week’s future journal (what you thought would happen vs. what actually happened).\n\nAdd sensory details: what you saw, heard, smelled, tasted, and felt.\n\nKeep it interesting—focus on special or fun moments, not just a list of events.\n\nOrganize your writing with a clear beginning, middle, and ending.\n\nYou can include one or two similes to make your writing more vivid, for example: “as bright as the full moon” or “like a quiet song.”\n\nExample Journal (Mr. Smith’s Chuseok)\n\nChuseok is a wonderful time to celebrate family, food, and traditions. This year, I had a mix of rest, fun, and special family moments.\n\nFirst, I stayed at home and finally had time to rest. I also organized my things because my room was such a mess, and cleaning it made me feel as free as a bird. One day, I went to Seoul and visited a beautiful palace. After that, I walked along Cheonggyecheon Stream, which was peaceful and cool like a quiet song. Later, I enjoyed a picnic at the Han River with my family\n\nI also visited my parents-in-law’s house, where we ate lots of delicious homecooked food. We played the traditional game Yutnori together, and everyone laughed and cheered. Another day, I went to some events with my three kids. Spending quality time with them was as bright and joyful as the Chuseok full moon.\n\nChuseok gave me many good memories, and I came back feeling grateful and refreshed. I hope everyone else had a wonderful holiday too, and I am ready to return to school after the break.\n\nExtra reading\n\nFor Chuseok, I have assigned some extra ReadWorks passages with stories about how people celebrate their culture.
