Write in the past tense. Use sensory words such as what you saw, heard, smelled, touched, and tasted. Have a clear structure with a beginning to introduce what you did, a middle with details and sensory words, and an ending to explain how you felt or why it was special. Try to stretch your ideas by giving more information about one exciting part instead of listing too many different things. Example Journal My Weekend On Saturday, I went on a multicultural family trip to meet other families in my neighborhood. We made things with clay, and I felt the soft, cool clay squish between my fingers. I saw bright colors and smelled the earthy scent of the clay. Everyone laughed and talked, and I heard the gentle tapping of tools on the clay. After that, we rode some horses. The horses’ warm fur brushed against my legs, and I felt my heart beat fast as we trotted around. I heard the hooves clopping on the ground and the wind whooshing past my ears. On Sunday, I spent time with my three kids. We went to the playground, and I heard the swings creak as they moved back and forth. I felt the rough ropes when I pushed the swings. The air was warm, and I heard the laughter of my children playing. Later, we visited the Catholic church to pray. The church smelled faintly of candles, and the sunlight shone through the colorful stained-glass windows. I listened quietly to the soft singing and felt calm and peaceful inside. After church, we had dinner outside. I tasted delicious grilled food, and I felt happy sharing the meal together. This weekend was special because I met new families on Saturday and spent time with my children on Sunday. Social Studies Pages 14-17 should be completed in the Social Studies Book.
