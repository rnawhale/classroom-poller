On Saturday, my family came to MCA for the Open House. I was so excited to show my parents our classroom. I showed them my desk, my storybook project, and even where I sit during reading time. My mom said our classroom looked bright and colorful, and my dad liked the posters on the wall. I felt proud when they smiled at my work.\n\nIn the afternoon, we went to a kids café. It was noisy with children laughing and running around. I jumped into the big ball pit, and the plastic balls felt cool and bumpy on my arms. I also tried the slide, and it was so fast that my stomach felt ticklish when I went down.\n\nOn Sunday, we went to the park to play with some other families. The air smelled fresh, and I could hear birds chirping in the trees. I played tag with my friends until my legs felt tired. In the evening, we had pizza for dinner. The cheese was gooey and hot, and the crust was crunchy. I thought it was delicious and the best way to end the weekend.\n\nWriting Tips for Next Time\n\n1) Check your spelling carefully.\n2) Use the past tense since you are writing about what already happened.\n3) Make sure you have a clear beginning, middle, and ending.\n4) Choose one exciting thing and add more details.\n5) Use sensory words like what you saw, heard, smelled, felt, or tasted.\n6) Add your emotions so readers know how you felt.\n\nSpanish Homework\n\nAll about me worksheet test. Next Thursday!",
