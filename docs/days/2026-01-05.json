Please bring a small bag if you want to carry a water bottle. It will be busy, so make sure it is something easy to carry.\n\nStudents may also bring one small snack in their bag.\n\nThere is no extra homework tonight. However, Khan Academy and ReadWorks are always available if students would like to do some optional practice.\n\nLooking forward to another great day of Leadership Camp tomorrow!",
