          "details": "Leadership Camp continues tomorrow. I hope everyone had fun working with their teams and enjoying today’s activities. Tomorrow morning, we will visit Job World. Please bring a small bag if you want to carry a water bottle. It will be busy, so make sure it is something easy to carry. Students may also bring one small snack in their bag. There is no extra homework tonight. However, Khan Academy and ReadWorks are always available if students would like to do some optional practice. Looking forward to another great day of Leadership Camp tomorrow!",
