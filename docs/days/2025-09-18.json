You need to read your chapter in the book and summarize the important information. Then you will reteach your lesson to the class. You must do three things. A Google Slides or PowerPoint presentation that is bright and clear. An A3 poster that is colorful and eye-catching. A quiz that is fun and gets the class involved. The quiz could be an X and O quiz, a fill in the gap quiz, or something online. Each person in the group should take one job. One person makes the slides. One person makes the poster.
