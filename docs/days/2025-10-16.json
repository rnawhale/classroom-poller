Tonight, begin working on the final draft of your story and start decorating it. It should be presented on one side of an A4 paper so we can display it on the window for others to read. You may type your story and decorate around it, or write it by hand using your best handwriting—just make sure it’s big enough for others to read easily. Tomorrow, you’ll have more time in the first class to continue working on it. I want to see vibrant colors to make your story come to life! You can add stickers, origami, or your own drawings. This will be graded as a project, and the final piece of work should be given to me on Tuesday, the 21st. Example Origin Myths How the Firefly Got Its Light Once, deep in a rainforest dripping with rain and echoing with frogs, there lived a tiny gray beetle who was always ignored. The butterflies showed off their colors, and the bees buzzed proudly about their honey, but the little beetle had nothing special. One night, as he sat sadly by a puddle, a falling star splashed beside him. “You look dim,” said the star kindly. “Would you like a bit of my shine?” The beetle nodded shyly, and the star touched his back. Suddenly, a golden glow burst from the beetle’s tail! He flew into the night, lighting the forest like a tiny lantern. From that night on, he shared his light with others who felt unseen—and that’s how fireflies came to sparkle across the dark forests every summer night. Why Zebras Have Stripes Long ago, zebras were plain white and loved to roll in the mud. One hot day, a zebra found a cool, shiny black rock and lay down on it to rest. When he stood up, black lines covered his back! The other zebras thought he looked amazing and wanted lines too. They rolled and rolled across the rock until their bodies were covered in black stripes. Ever since then, zebras have worn their stripes proudly under the sun. Why the Parrot Has Bright Feathers Long ago, all parrots were gray and dull. They lived quietly in the jungle trees, afraid of being noticed. One day, Rainbow, the sky painter, flew over the forest with buckets of color. She was in such a hurry to finish painting the sunset that she tripped over a tall tree—and Red, yellow, green, and blue paint rained down on the parrots below! The parrots gasped when they saw their shiny new feathers. They squawked and danced and showed off their bright colors to every animal in the jungle. Rainbow laughed and said, “You wear my colors better than the sky!” And ever since that day, parrots have been the most colorful birds in the world.
