Discuss with your group and start generating fun and exciting ideas for your booth. Your booth should have: Something to teach (1–2 minutes) An activity visitors can try (3–4 minutes) Pictures and decorations – write, draw, or color, using green, white, and orange Team balance – make sure everyone in your group contributes fairly. Some students are going home and spending hours preparing, while others need to try harder. Think about how you can add value, make your group better, and make it more fun for everyone. Individual and group grades – the work you do for the board and activity will be graded individually, and how you interact with other students during World Heritage Day will also be part of your grade. Think carefully about your ideas and come to class ready to share them. Be creative and make your booth fun and engaging for everyone who visits the Ireland show room.
