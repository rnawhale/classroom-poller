A Google Slides or PowerPoint presentation that is bright and clear. An A3 poster that is colorful and eye-catching. A quiz that is fun and gets the class involved. The quiz could be an X and O quiz, a fill-in-the-gap quiz, or something online. Each person in the group should take one job. One person makes the slides. One person makes the poster.
