          "details": "Happy New Year everyone 🎉\n\nI hope 2026 is your best year yet and that you’ve had a good break to rest and recharge.\n\nTomorrow we start school with two days of leadership camp. This is a great chance to ease back into school life, reconnect with each other, and set a positive tone for the year ahead.\n\nLet’s use this time to refocus, set goals, and begin our learning adventure for 2026. Try your best, support each other, and most importantly, enjoy the journey.\n\nI’m really looking forward to seeing all of my 3-1 class tomorrow — refreshed, motivated, and ready for action! 💪📚",
