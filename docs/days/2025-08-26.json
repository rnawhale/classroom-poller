Your project should include physical geography such as mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, and forests. It should also include human geography like population, celebrations, foods, and famous buildings or landmarks. Don’t forget to add other important facts such as the language, currency, country flag, a map of the country and city, and any other interesting details you would like to share. Your poster should be bright, colorful, and creative so we can decorate our classroom with them. Tomorrow, each student will present their poster to the class for about 1–2 minutes.
