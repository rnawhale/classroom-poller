          "details": "Regular School Starts Tomorrow! We had a great time on the school trip and at leadership camp today. Thank you to everyone for your positive attitude and effort. It was great to see you enjoying the activities and working well together. Tomorrow, we will resume our regular classes. Please come to school prepared with all the necessary books and materials for your daily studies. Today’s homework is the future job activity. On the first page, write three careers (jobs) you are interested in. For each job, explain why you like it and what skills are needed for that job. On the other pages, draw the job you want to have. You should also draw a picture of yourself doing this job in the future. As usual, please complete the homework carefully. Make sure your drawings are neat and fully colored, as we may display them on the classroom wall.",
