The butterflies showed off their colors, and the bees buzzed proudly about their honey, but the little beetle had nothing special.\n\nOne night, as he sat sadly by a puddle, a falling star splashed beside him. “You look dim,” said the star kindly. “Would you like a bit of my shine?”\n\nThe beetle nodded shyly, and the star touched his back. Suddenly, a golden glow burst from the beetle’s tail! He flew into the night, lighting the forest like a tiny lantern.\n\nFrom that night on, he shared his light with others who felt unseen—and that’s how fireflies came to sparkle across the dark forests every summer night.\n\nWhy Zebras Have Stripes\n\nLong ago, zebras were plain white and loved to roll in the mud. One hot day, a zebra found a cool, shiny black rock and lay down on it to rest. When he stood up, black lines covered his back! The other zebras thought he looked amazing and wanted lines too. They rolled and rolled across the rock until their bodies were covered in black stripes. Ever since then, zebras have worn their stripes proudly under the sun.\n\nWhy the Parrot Has Bright Feathers\nLong ago, all parrots were gray and dull. They lived quietly in the jungle trees, afraid of being noticed. One day, Rainbow, the sky painter, flew over the forest with buckets of color. She was in such a hurry to finish painting the sunset that she tripped over a tall tree—and \n\nRed, yellow, green, and blue paint rained down on the parrots below!\nThe parrots gasped when they saw their shiny new feathers. They squawked and danced and showed off their bright colors to every animal in the jungle.\n\nRainbow laughed and said, “You wear my colors better than the sky!”\n\nAnd ever since that day, parrots have been the most colorful birds in the world.\n\nExample Myth stories\n\nHow the rainbow was made\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2W42HzDo1A\n\nWhy the Sky is far away\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLmBR0s8TY8\n\nWhy the sea is salty\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7GJIzjXlJ4 \n\nExtra reading\n\nPlease go to ReadWorks and complete some of the stories assigned.
