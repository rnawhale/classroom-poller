(TOMORROW) Hi 3-1! Tomorrow I need your page for our Bookaween storybook for Halloween. Use the guide we went over today to help you. Here is what to do: Make your own page for your character. Think about the other characters too so your page matches the story. Write your part of the story clearly on your page so everyone can read it. Use lots of color to make your page fun and Halloween-y! I have attached the story to this announcement. Please feel free to change things and add your own touches. I want you to make it your own, but keep the story similar so the whole story makes sense. We will have 12 pages completed by Thursday. After that, we can make the cover (page 1) and the back page together. Can’t wait to see your amazing pages! 🖍️✨ Math The math test is TOMORROW!
