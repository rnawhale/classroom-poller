          "details": "📢 Thanksgiving Break Homework Update\n\nI tried to give you as little homework as possible over the break because you all worked so hard today! You completed two tests, and we also enjoyed some play time to relax before Thanksgiving. 🍂🦃\n\nHere is the homework for the break:\n\nReading: Catch up on your assigned ReadWorks activities.\n\nMath: Spend a little time on Khan Academy.\n\nScience & Social Studies: No homework!\n\nLanguage Arts, Spanish & Korean: Homework was posted yesterday.\n\nJournal: Write one free journal about what you did on your long Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nThe most important homework is to prepare for the Winter Festival! It is in about two weeks, so please practice the dance moves for Jingle Bell Rock and Soda Pop with high energy. For the ballet part, remember to show calm and peaceful movements.\n\nEnjoy the time with your family, rest well, and have a wonderful break! 🌟",
