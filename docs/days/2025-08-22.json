          "details": "Reading Today, students took their STAR Reading quiz. I will be sending home a letter for parents to review their child’s current level.

A personal narrative is a story about something that happened to you, or something you are going to do. You will tell it in your own words and include your feelings, thoughts, and experiences. Steps to Complete Your Personal Narrative Plan in your My View book. Think about what you want to write about and pick one small event from your weekend. Add details. Write what you saw, heard, smelled, tasted, and felt. Use order words like First, Then, Next, After that, Finally to help your story flow. Show your feelings. Were you happy, nervous, excited, or scared? Write your story in your journal notebook. Make sure it has a beginning, middle, and end. ✏️ Example Personal Narrative My Weekend Plans My Weekend This weekend was a little scary and very fun. On Saturday morning, I went to the dentist to get a dental implant. I felt a little nervous because it was my first time having an implant. First, the dentist checked my teeth and prepared my mouth. Then, they carefully put in the implant. It didn’t hurt too much, and I knew it would make my tooth strong and healthy. After it was done, I went home and rested. On Sunday, I took my three kids to a kids' café. I was excited because I knew they would have so much fun. First, we ordered drinks and snacks. Then, my kids played in the ball pit, climbed on the slides, and tried the toys. I watched them and helped when they needed it. After that, we ate some cake and ice cream together. Finally, we went home feeling happy and tired from all the fun. I enjoyed my weekend. Saturday was a little scary, but Sunday was full of laughter and fun with my kids. ✅ Quick Checklist Make sure you picked one small event from your weekend. Write what happens first, next, and last. Include your feelings and thoughts. Add details about what you saw, heard, smelled, tasted, or felt. Check that your story has a beginning, middle, and end. Social Studies 🌍 Social Studies Project Homework (DUE AUG 27th) We have started our first social studies project! 🎉 Each student will choose one country (not Korea, since we are learning about other countries) and one city in that country. You will create a poster on A3 paper that includes: Physical Geography – mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, forests Human Geography – population, celebrations, foods, famous buildings or landmarks Other Important Facts – language, currency, country flag, a map of the country and city, and any other interesting facts you would like to share. Your poster should be bright, colorful, and creative so we can decorate our classroom with them. Each student will present their poster to the class next week for about 1–2 minutes. Please work on your poster over the weekend so you have time to make it detailed and colorful. . Try to log into readworks and khanacademy when you have time! HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!",
