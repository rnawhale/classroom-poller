          "details": "Upcoming Tests\nMath - Topic 7 - December 11th (Check the practice test)\n\nMr Smith’s Classroom Books\nStudents are welcome to take books from Mr Smith’s classroom library and read them over the winter break. These books belong to our classroom, so please make sure to return them when you are finished. I do not keep a checklist, so I trust everyone to bring the books back so all students can continue to enjoy them.\n\nIf you have any books at home that you are finished with and would like to donate to Mr Smith’s classroom library, please feel free to send them in. We will add them to the library so everyone in 3-1 can read and share them.\n\nI am very proud of how active my students are with their reading, so let’s keep promoting a strong reading culture in 3-1!\n\nToday is the last day I will post homework in 2025.\nOver the winter break, there is a Winter Pack for students to use to keep reading and practising.\n\nThere is also a book chart for students to continue completing AR quizzes. Khan Academy is always available to work on, as well as ReadWorks and Epic, if students need extra things to do.\n\nWorking on Khan Academy for Grade 3, 4, or even 5 will really help improve MAP score outcomes. Reading books at home will also support every part of your learning—reading truly is the key to everything.\n\nThe Winter Pack will also help you prepare for some of the topics we will learn next year.\n\nEnjoy your winter break and keep learning a little each day!\n\nWinter Festival Countdown!\n\nThe Winter Festival is coming up this Friday—only 2 more sleeps to go! We can’t wait to see everyone shine on stage.\n\nIt’s time to practice. Please watch the video below and keep practicing your part at home so we are ready for a great performance. Remember, it’s all about having fun! Don’t worry about getting every step perfect—just practice and enjoy it.\n\nPlease try to wear Christmassy clothes on the day of the festival if you can. Red and green are great choices.\n\nLet’s get festival-ready and have an amazing time together. Go team!\n\nReading\n\nGet to page 409 in the My View Book\nThe story this week is Nature's patchwork quilt\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u5Y_Ln2imI\n\nThe spelling test is TOMORROW!

They will assist you with your schoolwork and also enhance your overall reading skills.\n\nGo to www.readworks.org/student \n\nMath\nThe test is TOMORROW. Please read over the red assessment pages we went over.\n\nI have added New Khan Academy lessons related to data.\n\nPlease have your child practice a little Khan Academy math each night\n at https://www.khanacademy.org/join/VK6QDS9E to help strengthen their skills.\n\nScience\nWe have finished the science book for this year, and we will return to it in January.\n\nOver the winter break, there is no science homework, but in the Winter Vacation Pack, there is some space to think about ideas for science experiments.\n\nYou can use that space to plan simple experiments you might want to try when we come back, or to start thinking about a project for the Science Fair in April.\n\nWhen you have time, think of a few small experiment ideas or anything you might like to explore for the Science Fair. I’m excited to see your ideas in the new year!\n\nSocial Studies\nWell done on completing the Social Studies test today!\n\nWe have no more Social Studies from the book for the rest of this year, and we will return to it in January.\n\nIn the Winter Vacation Study Pack, I have included some vocabulary from the next chapter. These words might be a little tricky, so please take some time to make a small glossary using pictures and simple definitions. When we study this chapter next year, it will be much easier for you.\n\nGreat job on the test today—I know Social Studies can be tough because there are many details to remember. Keep up the good work!\n\nLanguage Arts\nGrammar Workshop 98-103 (Thurs)\n\nVocabulary Workshop 86-87 (Thurs)\n\nKorean \n\nWinter Break Homework\n\nPages 230-246\nPages 251-253",
