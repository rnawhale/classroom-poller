          "details": "Upcoming Tests Tuesday January 20th - Vocabulary Workshop Unit 1-9 Tuesday Januart 20th - Grammar Worshop - Unit 3 (Verbs) Wednesday January - 21st - Math Topic 8 Reading update There is no reading homework from our textbooks at the moment, so I expect students to complete their reading through ReadWorks instead. This ensures everyone is still practicing reading regularly. Reading - Heroes / Titanic Social Studies - Branches of Govern Science - Volcanic Eruptions These stories will help you with many subjects. Please make sure students are logging into ReadWorks and completing the assigned stories. I have added new passages, including one about the Titanic and another on the three branches of government, which link closely to our class learning. Students should also read the books they borrowed from the library today and complete AR quizzes for those books once finished. How to log in: Go to www.readworks.org/student Class code: YU6GQ2 Password: 1234 (unless already changed) Thank you for your continued support.
