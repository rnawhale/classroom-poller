Please complete pages 42-43 in the book and review every page before the test on Tuesday. (Pages 8-43)\n\nComplete 1 more journal\n\nExample Journal\nThis weekend, my family and I spent time together at church and at the park.\n\nOn Saturday, my kids went to the Catholic church for their class. They met other children and played together after class. Later, we joined the youth service. The singing was loud and joyful, and I could smell the snacks being prepared in the next room. After the service, families stayed to share cookies and juice. The cookies were sweet, and the juice was cold.\n\nOn Sunday, we went for a walk around the lake near our house. We enjoyed listening to buskers singing and even saw a small concert. The music was cheerful, and the warm sun sparkled on the water. After walking, we bought ice cream. My chocolate ice cream melted quickly, and it tasted creamy and sweet. Later, we ate pasta for lunch together.\n\nIt was a wonderful weekend.  I felt happy and thankful that my family could spend time together and make special memories.\n\nTips for Writing a Good Journal\n\n1) Use the past tense. Example: I played, we walked, she sang.\n\n2) Check spelling in a dictionary. Don’t guess—look it up if you are not sure.\n\n3) Add sensory words, things you can see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. Example: The ice cream was cold and sweet.\n\n4) Keep a clear structure. Beginning: say when and where. Middle: tell what happened. End: share how you felt.\n\n5) Focus on one or two big events. Don’t try to list everything you did.\n\n6) Use interesting words. Instead of always saying good or fun, try words like exciting, tasty, relaxing, cheerful, loud, and peaceful.\n\nSocial Studies \n\nRead and complete pages 40-42 in the social studies book.  These are the assessment practice pages, which will help you prepare for the upcoming test.\n\nSocial Studies Group Project\n\nYour groups are: \n\nLand and Water -  Stella / Jenny / Jiwoo\nWeather, Climate and Forces of Nature - Siwoo / Ian Choi / Jason\nUsing Earth’s Resources - Jey / Noah / Alex\nInteracting with the Environment -  Woojoo / Yujoo / Ian Sa\n\nEach group has three students. You need to read your chapter in the book and summarize the important information. Then you will reteach your lesson to the class.\n\nYou must do three things. A Google Slides or PowerPoint presentation that is bright and clear. An A3 poster that is colorful and eye-catching. A quiz that is fun and gets the class involved. The quiz could be an X and O quiz, a fill-in-the-gap quiz, or something online.\n\nEach person in the group should take one job. One person makes the slides. One person makes the poster. One person makes the quiz.\n\nYour goal is to make your classmates learn from you in a fun and creative way. You will present this on Wednesday, September 24th, the lesson before the social studies test.\n\nReadWorks Assignment 5/6 – Tropical Rainforests / Natural Resources (8 stories)\n\nI have assigned a story on Rainforest and 8 stories about natural disasters on ReadWorks. Please complete it within the next 2 weeks.\n\n Go to www.readworks.org/student \n\nEnter our class code YU6GQ2\nYour password is 1234 unless you already changed it",
