Here are some tips to help you write a strong entry: Focus on one interesting event from your weekend. Don’t try to write about everything—choose something that really stands out to you. Use past tense since you are writing about something that already happened. Include a clear opening (introduce your event) and a closing statement (wrap up your thoughts or feelings about it). Make it interesting for the reader! Share details, your feelings, or something funny or surprising. Take your time and write thoughtfully. I’m excited to read about your weekend adventures! ✨ Social Studies 🇮🇪 World Heritage Day – Ireland Project Hi everyone! It’s time to start for our Ireland project.
