Here are some tips to help you write a strong entry:\n\nFocus on one interesting event from your weekend. Don’t try to write about everything—choose something that really stands out to you.\nUse past tense since you are writing about something that already happened.\nInclude a clear opening (introduce your event) and a closing statement (wrap up your thoughts or feelings about it).\nMake it interesting for the reader! Share details, your feelings, or something funny or surprising.\nTake your time and write thoughtfully. I’m excited to read about your weekend adventures! ✨\n\nSocial Studies\n\n🇮🇪 World Heritage Day – Ireland Project\nHi everyone!\nIt’s time to start  for our Ireland project.
