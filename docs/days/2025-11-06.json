Our class made a book called, and we presented it to everyone on the big stage. I felt a little nervous at first, but it was also exciting to perform. The gym was filled with bright lights, colorful costumes, and loud cheers—it felt like being in a real theater!\n\nAfter the presentations, we had lots of fun activities. We tossed rings, made Halloween crafts, and played outside in the cool, fresh air. The laughter and music made it feel like a big festival.\n\nThe sweetest part of the day was when Principal Ms. Ryu gave us candy. It tasted as sweet as success after all our hard work. My cheeks were sore from smiling, and my hands were sticky from crafts, but my heart felt happy and proud.\n\nBookaween with 3-1 was an amazing day full of fun, color, and teamwork. I’ll never forget how great it felt to share our story with everyone!\n\nReminder!\nRemember to log into Khan Academy and Readworks a few times a week!\n\nWorld Heritage Day – Parent Notice\n\nDear Parents,\n\nToday I sent home a letter about our World Heritage Day event, which will take place on Thursday, November 20.\n\nPlease check your child’s bag for the letter and return the food donation form by Wednesday, November 13, if you would like to participate.\n\nOur class (3-1) will represent Ireland, and parents are invited to prepare one Irish dish to share (approximately 5–6 servings).\n\nHere are some Irish food ideas you can choose from:\n\nMashed potatoes\nPotato pancakes (Boxty)\nIrish soda bread (with butter or jam)\nScones\nShortbread or butter cookies\nApple cake or apple tart\nIrish sausages (small pieces or mini sausages)\nMini shepherd’s pie cups\nCheese and crackers (Irish cheddar if available)\nGreen cupcakes or snacks to show Irish colors\nThank you very much for your support and for helping make our World Heritage Day a special experience for the students.\n\n— Mr. Smith\n\nUpcoming Tests\nMath Topic 5 Tuesday, Nov 11th\nGrammar Workshop Unit 2 NOUNS (L9-14) Thursday, Nov 13th\nSocial Studies\n\nWorld Heritage Day – Ireland Project Update 🇮🇪\nGreat job, everyone!
