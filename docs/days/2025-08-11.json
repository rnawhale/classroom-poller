          "details": "What a great first day! 🎉\n\nWe started with a delicious breakfast, caught up with friends, met some new classmates, and enjoyed a fun whole-school assembly. The day was filled with icebreaker games, a class tour, games on the soccer field, leadership activities, a quiz, and even ice cream! 🍦\n\nI can’t wait to continue tomorrow with more games and teamwork!\n\nParents — please comment below with your child’s name so I can confirm everyone is in our Google Classroom. Some email addresses don’t show who the student is.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nMr. Smith",
