Today, we’ll keep working on our mini books so they’re neat, bright, and fun—something people will want to come and read at the Open House. ✨\nTry adding special touches like a colorful bookmark, some string or ribbon for binding, or even a shiny cover to make your storybook stand out. Show off your creativity—you’re the authors and illustrators, and we can’t wait to share your finished books with everyone! 📖💡\n\nThese are the spelling words for this Friday\n\nallow\nfaint\ngoal \ntrace\nbitter\nfirm\npatient \ncommon \nforce \nprefer\n\nReadWorks Assignment 4 – Fables\n\nI have assigned 7 fables for you to complete in ReadWorks.
