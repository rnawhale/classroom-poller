This ensures everyone is still practicing reading regularly.\n\nPlease make sure students are logging into ReadWorks and completing the assigned stories. I have added new passages, including one about the Titanic and another on the three branches of government, which link closely to our class learning.\n\nStudents should also read the books they borrowed from the library today and complete AR quizzes for those books once finished.\n\nHow to log in:\n\nGo to www.readworks.org/student\n\nClass code: YU6GQ2\n\nPassword: [REDACTED] (unless already changed)\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nMath\n\nComplete Additional Practice 8-5 student book and homework book.\n\nI have added New Khan Academy lessons related to data.\n\nPlease have your child practice a little Khan Academy math each night\n at https://www.khanacademy.org/join/VK6QDS9E to help strengthen their skills.\n\nScience  (Tomorrow)\n\nRead and complete pages 142-147\n\nComplete the climate change worksheet.\n\nWatch the videos about climate change to embed knowledge\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkvPdUtYhX8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tykLKCT7DyY  \n\nSocial Studies\n\nRead and complete pages 150-155\n\nWatch the videos about the 3 branches of government to embed knowledge\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvwlRTYvU8o\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRVX8Qn88MQ&list=RDPRVX8Qn88MQ&start_radio=1\n\nLanguage Arts\n\nComplete pages 110-111 in the grammar workshop book",
