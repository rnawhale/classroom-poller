This board will be used to show your understanding of your book in a clear, creative, and visual way. Your work must be neat, colourful, well organised, and easy to read.\n\nMiddle of the Board (Center Section)\n\nThe centre of the board must include the picture you drew in art class. This picture should clearly relate to your book and show an important scene, character, or idea.\n\nUnder the picture, you must include the following information clearly written or typed:\n\nBook title\nAuthor\nPublisher\nDate the book was published\nMake sure this information is centred and easy to read.\n\nLeft Side of the Board\n\nThe left side of the board must include the following sections:\n\nMain characters (include pictures and names)\nSetting (where and when the story takes place, include pictures)\nPlot (a short summary of what happens in the story)\nEach section should be clearly labelled with a heading. You may type your answers, but the font size must be large enough to read from a distance.\n\nRight Side of the Board\n\nThe right side of the board must include:\n\nThe problem\nThe solution\nAuthor’s purpose (why did the author write this book)\nWhy I liked the book\nFive key words from the book with short explanations\nEach section must be labelled and neatly organised. Typed work is allowed, but handwriting is also fine if it is neat and clear.\n\nTheme and Design\n\nYour poster must have a clear theme that matches your book and runs through the entire board.\n\nFor example, if your book is Harry Potter, you could decorate the board with small wands, stars, or magical symbols to separate sections. If your book is about sports, animals, mystery, or adventure, your decorations should match that idea.\n\nUse colours, borders, shapes, and images to make your board eye catching and professional.\n\nPictures and Graphics\n\nYou must include pictures for the main characters and the setting. These can be printed or neatly drawn. Your board should be highly visual, not just text.\n\nYour goal is to make your board graphic, creative, informative, and high quality.\n\nUpcoming Tests\nThursday January 22nd - Math Topic 8\nFriday January 23rd - Vocabulary Workshop Unit 1-9\n\nReading\n\nComplete 52-55 in the my view book.
