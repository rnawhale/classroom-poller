          "details": "Not much extra homework today! There is not much homework today, so this is a good chance to go back and check if you have missed any homework. If you have any missing homework, please bring it to school tomorrow so your grade can be updated. Remember, it is your responsibility to complete and submit any missing work. Please take time and care when doing your homework. If the writing is hard to read or it looks like little time was spent on it, it may not receive the best grade. Homework is a chance to review what we learned in class, so try your best and check your work before coming to school. Literary Fair Update We have now added all of the required Literary Fair information to the boards in class. This includes the main character, the setting, the plot, the conflict, the solution, the theme, the reason you liked the book, and the key words. Tomorrow, the boards will be sent home. Over the weekend, you will decorate your board and make it creative and interesting. Please take good care of it while it is at home. Tonight, start thinking of creative ideas for how you want your board to look so you are ready to work on it over the weekend. All completed boards must be brought back to school on Monday so we can continue with the next steps of the project. Reading Complete the definion paper with 3 example sentences.
