Some students are going home and spending hours preparing, while others need to try harder. Think about how you can add value, make your group better, and make it more fun for everyone.\nIndividual and group grades – the work you do for the board and activity will be graded individually, and how you interact with other students during World Heritage Day will also be part of your grade.\nThink carefully about your ideas and come to class ready to share them. Be creative and make your booth fun and engaging for everyone who visits the Ireland showroom.\n\nReminder: If you plan to send a food donation, please send the letter by November 13th.",
