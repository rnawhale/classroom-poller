          "details": "Hello everyone 😊 The Winter Festival is tomorrow. We had our rehearsal today, and I was very impressed with the effort from the whole class. The first song, Jingle Bell Rock, and the ballet section were wonderful. For the ballet part, it would help if students stayed steady and kept their positions in line. For the final song, Soda Pop, they can add a bit more energy, enthusiasm, and big smiles. The ending felt a little low-energy, but Soda Pop should be a high-energy moment. Making mistakes is totally fine — the most important thing is that they enjoy themselves. They will have one more practice tomorrow before taking the stage to entertain the MCA families. Please remember to dress each child in Christmas-style clothes with lots of red and green. Also, please don’t forget to bring instruments tomorrow for orchestra time. There is no more homework. Students can focus on the winter pack, Khan Academy, ReadWorks, Epic reading, and reading their books. They should add a sticker for every AR quiz they complete. There will also be some students selling small items at school tomorrow, so if you want your child to participate, you may give them a small amount of money. Let’s finish 2025 on a high note! 🎄✨",
