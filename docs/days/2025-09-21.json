          "details": "MAP Testing Starts Tomorrow! On Monday, we will do Science. On Wednesday, we will do Reading. On Thursday, we will do Math. On Friday, we will do Language Arts. MAP stands for Measures of Academic Progress. It is a test that helps us see how much you have learned and how you are growing in different subjects. It is not about grades. The most important thing is to try your best. To prepare for Language Arts, you can look through your Grammar Workshop and Vocabulary Workshop books. You can also log in to ReadWorks and read more books at home. Reading will also help in every subject. To prepare for Math, you can look over your math book from school. You can also log in to Khan Academy to practice. If the work feels too easy, you can try higher grade levels. To prepare for Science, the best way is to look through your science book. Reading more nonfiction books will also help. For Social Studies, you can do the same by reviewing your book and reading nonfiction. Remember that MAP is about showing what you know and trying your best. Get a good night’s sleep, eat breakfast, and stay calm so you can do your best on the test. You can do it!",
