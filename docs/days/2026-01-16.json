Use time words like first, then, after that, and finally to help organize your ideas. Remember to check your spelling, punctuation, and capital letters before you finish. Sample journal Last weekend was busy and exciting. On Saturday, I went to the dentist with my daughter. I felt very nervous at first, but I tried to be brave. The dentist visit went well, and I felt relieved afterward. After that, my daughter and I ate some delicious food together. Then we took a walk along Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul and enjoyed looking at the water and walking together. On Sunday, my wife went out, so I stayed home with my three kids. It was cold outside, so we stayed indoors and played board games and pool. We also played Blooket, and everyone laughed a lot. I had so much fun spending time with my kids. In the end, I had a great weekend. Even though I was nervous at first, I felt happy and proud. Spending time with my family made the weekend special.
